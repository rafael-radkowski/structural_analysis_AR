The latest release of iStructAR includes a new task, modeling the Campanile Tower at Iowa State University, an iconic building on the school's campus. Modeled as a cantilevered beam, students are able to see the affect of different types of loading conditions on the structure. Both wind and seismic forces are a focus in this new task. 

Both version 1.2.1 (Skywalk only) and version 1.3.1 (Skywalk and Campanile Tower) are available for download on our "Downloads" page. When wanting to use "indoor" tracking modes, make sure to download the appropriate images for indoor or off-site use.
