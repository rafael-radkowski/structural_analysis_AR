The latest release of iStructAR includes a new task, modeling the Campanile Tower at Iowa State University, an iconic building on the school's campus. Utilized as a cantilevered beam, students are able to see the effect of different types of loading conditions on the structure. Both wind and seismic forces are a focus in this new task. 

Both version 1.2.1 (Skywalk only) and version 1.3.1 (Skywalk and Campanile Tower) are available for download on our "Downloads" page. If indoors or off-site, make sure to download the appropriate images for use with "indoor" tracking modes.
