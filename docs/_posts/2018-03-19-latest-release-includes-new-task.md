title: "Latest Release Includes New Task"

The latest release of iStructAR includes a new task, modeling the Campanile Tower at Iowa State University, an iconic building on the school's campus. Modeled as a cantilevered beam, students are able to see the affect of different types of loading conditions on the structure. Both wind and seismic forces are a focus in this new task.
